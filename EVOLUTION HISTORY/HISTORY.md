This folder holds 90 snapshots of our robot software as it grew from
nothing into something that drives, sees, thinks, and parks.

Each version folder has:
- `CHANGE.md` — what changed, why, what broke, how we fixed it
- Code files — the actual code at that moment (warts and all)

## What Each Folder Contains

Every version folder has at least:
- `CHANGE.md` — the story: what, why, error, fix, alternatives, lesson
- Code files showing how the robot looked at that exact moment

The code is NOT always correct. That is the point. You see bugs as they
happened, fixes as we applied them, and the robot growing version by version.
